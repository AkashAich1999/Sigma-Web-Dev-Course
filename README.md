# Sigma-Web-Dev-Course
 To track my progress (source codes) throughout the Sigma Web Development Course taught by CodeWithHarry

 I appreciate the efforts made by Instructor. He really taught HTML, CSS & Tailwind CSS really well. The projects created during the course was also fun.
 Projects : 
 1) Netflix Home Page UI (using HTML & CSS)
 2) Spotify Clone (Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript)
 3) Twitter Clone (using Tailwind CSS)

 Anyone following his playlist can go through the HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Intro) & Tailwind CSS. Harry sir did his Job quite well, but due to lengthy & repetitive nature of his JavaScript videos, I will Recommend to re-learn JavaScript from somewhere else once you finish till Video 84.
